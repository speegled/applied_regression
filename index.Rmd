# Preface

These notes are for an applied regression course using R. Mathematical derivations are de-emphasized, while simulations are used to provide evidence for many statements throughout the book. The prerequisite material for this book is contained in [Probability, Statistics, and Data: A Fresh Approach Using R](https://mathstat.slu.edu/~speegle/_book/preface.html) by Speegle and Clair.
