These are the Rbookdown files needed to build the class notes for MATH/STAT 4870 Applied Regression at Saint Louis University.
The book is hosted [here](https://mathstat.slu.edu/~speegle/Spring2020/4870/_book/index.html).

I welcome contributions, big or small! I will treat all contributors respectfully and expect the same from contributors.
